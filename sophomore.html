		<p class="style6"> Like a rocket launching into space, my understanding of aerospace engineering and the professional world has just begun to take shape. Over the next few years, I aim to expand my knowledge and put everything I've learned into action.</p>

		<h2 id="h2"> Planetary Sciences Laboratory @ UCF </h2>
		<p class="style5">At the start of the summer of 2023, I joined Dr. Kerri Donaldson Hanna’s Lab for planetary science, where I assisted postdoctoral student Audrey Martin with her study on lunar simulants. The project aimed to take Visible to Near Infrared Spectra of these samples to examine how changes in porosity and albedo are reflected in the spectra. My work began with learning how to efficiently measure multiple samples using a Nicolet iS50 FTIR Spectrometer, ensuring accuracy by comparing my measurements with pre-existing spectra.I played a key role in developing the sample products, testing different simulants, and meticulously documenting the process for future reference and optimization. 

 I also modified existing Python code to identify spectral graph continuums, contributing to the evaluation of reflectance data and the calculation of albedos for 40 diverse samples, including lunar and asteroid simulants.Throughout the project, I consistently engaged with my supervisors in regular meetings, ensuring clear communication and alignment with project objectives. I managed to complete all research assignments within specified timelines and deadlines, demonstrating strong organizational skills and adherence to the project schedule.
<br></br>
I actively participated in weekly meetings, where I provided detailed reports on my research findings and progress updates. Additionally, I delivered technical presentations during these meetings, discussing results and potential future innovations. I also leveraged the expertise of team members, offering support in using the spectrometer and various programming languages.

In March 2024, I presented my research through my first research poster, showcasing the work I contributed to the project and its significance in planetary science. A couple of months later, I presented this research at the 2024 NASA Exploration Science Forum (NESF), led by NASA SSERVI. Both of these experiences were invaluable, as they taught me how to effectively communicate and articulate my research to peers, graduate students, and industry professionals.</p>

		

		<h2 id="h2"> Knights Experimental Rocketry (KXR) - IREC Propulsion Team Member</h2>
		<p class="style5"> With the transition into Aerospace Engineering I was eager to get some hands-on experience. Therefore, I joined KXR and became a member of the propulsion team for the IREC team within the rocketry club at UCF. During the spring of 2024, I specialized in the Mechanical and Manufacturing subteam, where I contributed to the design of various rocket components and played a key role in the fabrication process. I utilized CAD software and modeling techniques to design parts such as bulkheads, umbilical systems, O-rings, and struts. To further enhance my skill set, I began expanding my knowledge of MATLAB for simulations, aiding in calculations and trajectories for model rockets. I also volunteered in the machine shop, which not only allowed me to save the club approximately $500 in assembly costs but also provided me with fundamental knowledge and hands-on experience using essential tools at my university's machine shop, including the manual mill, boring tools, and drilling tools. This experience deepened my understanding of the importance of selecting appropriate materials and structures for modern rockets. Additionally, I gained insight into evaluating the feasibility of propulsion and power systems, particularly when working with various combustion chambers. </p>

		<h2 id="h2"> Cornell Astrophysics and Planetary Sciences REU - ASTRA Lab </h2>
		<p class="style5">I was accepted into the Planetary Sciences and Astrophysics REU at Cornell University and assigned to work in the ASTRA Lab, a research facility focused on electro plasma sprays and spectroscopy. I was mentored by Kaylin Borders, a Ph.D. student leading the project, who was eager to see results by the end of the summer.

My work focused on researching cooling techniques for high-power Hall effect thrusters. Specifically, the research involved the fabrication and testing of cooling methods using a simulated plasma source, while also laying the groundwork for future thermal testing. Our primary objective was to determine whether implementing a water-cooling loop around a simulated thruster could significantly help maintain the system’s thermal threshold. This water-cooling approach serves as preliminary work to assess the feasibility of Regenerative Cooling, a technique commonly used in many chemical propulsion systems. By studying this method, we aim to develop a more effective thermal management system for future applications of Hall effect thrusters.

 My first responsibility was designing a test stand that met several key requirements, including adaptability for testing future variations, minimizing thermal contact, ensuring stability with the thruster, and allowing for adjustable height with standoffs. I thoroughly enjoyed creating different iterations of the model and ultimately learned a great deal about the modeling process and how it translates to manufacturing.

After completing the design, I spent the next week gathering the necessary materials and coordinating with the machine shop to have the plate water-jetted from aluminum. I then assembled the test stand using all the required components. To construct the prototype thruster, we used ceramic alumina and a stainless steel backplate.
<br> </br>
One of the challenges we encountered was finding a suitable adhesive to assemble the prototype thruster. The adhesive needed to have low outgassing properties, a high thermal threshold, and be vacuum-safe. After acquiring the adhesive, we used it to bond Teflon tubing around the thruster, creating our cooling system. We then used an industrial chiller to control the temperature of the water circulating around the thruster, and employed copper film and a heater to simulate the plasma source. Future work will involve using thermocouples to measure temperature variations at different points on the thruster to monitor the system's thermal performance. The team also plans to conduct thermal testing within a vacuum environment using a vacuum chamber.
<br> </br>
As we completed the testing, we developed a test plan and assembly handbook to document the steps for assembling the test stand and thruster, as well as instructions for using the chiller and heater and connecting them to the vacuum system. The test plan also included the start and shutdown procedures for vacuum testing, guidelines for performing data acquisition, and details on where all the materials were obtained.

Overall, I successfully created a versatile test stand designed for the project's longevity, meeting several key design requirements. We conducted extensive research to identify the most suitable adhesives for our needs and set up the testing system for future experiments and data acquisition. At the end of the internship, I prepared a poster and delivered a presentation to showcase our achievements and the work accomplished during the project.</p>

		<h2 id="h2"> IEEE UCF - Professional Development Chair </h2>
		<p class="style5">In June 2024, I assumed the role of Professional Development Chair at UCF IEEE to give back to my school and share my knowledge on career growth with the club. The club's board has been holding bi-weekly meetings leading up to the fall semester to prepare for events and collaborations with various companies. I have been developing plans and setting objectives for myself and my committee to meet deadlines and mitigate the workload during the fall semester. My goal is to help our members grow professionally and teach them how to effectively market themselves to recruiters and at job fairs. Additionally, I want to promote participation in research at our institution, as it offers incredible opportunities—some of which have personally benefited me. We are also planning to collaborate with other STEM student organizations to raise awareness of our club and foster teamwork and community within UCF. </p>

		<h2 id="h2"> NASA Kennedy Space Center - NASA OSTEM Intern </h2>
		<p class="style5">One of my most substantial accomplishments was my current internship at NASA because I finally had the opportunity to work alongside engineers and scientist in the space exploration industry. Currently at NASA, I am contributing to the Trash to Gas project by running tests of a pure oxygen system, recording gas data, and tackling challenges related to gas systems, such as fitting failures and leak checks. The aim of this project is to create a gas system that has the potential for gas reusability aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Additionally, I am supporting the testing and maintenance of vacuum chambers for the Molten Regolith Electrolysis (MRE) project, which will allow us to extract oxygen from molten regolith. I will also be providing analysis of gas data for the Plasma Gas Synthesis project. These experiences not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided me with valuable insights into real-world aerospace applications. </p>
